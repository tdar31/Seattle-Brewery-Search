# Seattle-Brewery-Search

http://www.seattlebrewerysearch.com/

Seattle Brewery Search is a site that provides an interactive map that shows the locations of all the breweries in the greater Seattle area.  The site uses the Google Maps API to generate the interactive map with custom markers for each brewery.

This is a project I started months ago but swapped over to React to rebuild/finish it.  https://github.com/tdar31/BrewerySearch2.0 is the old repo

Features that I plan to add

-   Build out 404 page

-   Filter by region

    -   Info already built out in database so shouldn't be too tricky more of a UI issue of where to put it?

-   Redesign markers
    -   Issues with overlapping
    -   Having the div be split into two pieces introduces some limitations for styling
