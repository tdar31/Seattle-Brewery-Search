# Seattle-Brewery-Search

http://www.seattlebrewerysearch.com/

Seattle Brewery Search is a site that provides an interactive map that shows the locations of all the breweries in the greater Seattle area.

Features that I plan to add

-   Build out 404 page

-   Filter by region

    -   Info already built out in database so shouldn't be too tricky more of a UI issue of where to put it?

-   Redesign markers
    -   Issues with overlapping
    -   Having the div be split into two pieces introduces some limitations for styling
